Logic
1. Read the number of applications. 
2. Maintain a count of eligible applications. Initialize it to 0.
3. Read the first unread applicant age, and compare it to 18. 
4. If the age is greater than 18, increase the count of eligible applications by 1.
5. If not greater, continue to the next application.
6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 for all applications.
