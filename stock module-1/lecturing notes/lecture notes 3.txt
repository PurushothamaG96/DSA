Arithmetic Operations 
Addition +
    Add the numbers on both sides of the operator
    > 4 + 5
    9
    > 23 + 4
    27
Subtraction -
    a - b => subtract b from a
    > 56 - 2
    54
    > 23 - 543
    -520
    > 23.5 - 3.2
    20.3
Multiplication *
    a * b => multiply a and b
    > 3*2
    6
    > 45 * 30
    1350
Division /
    a / b => divide a by b
    > 45/9
    5
    > 45/7
    6.428571428571429
Remainder or Modulo %
    a % b => Remainder obtained when a is divided by b
    
    6 % 3 => 
    dividend = (divisor * quotient) + remainder
    6 = (3 * 2) + 0
    7 % 3 =>
    7 = (3 * 2) + 1
Exponent **
    a ** b => a raised to the power of b

Output
1 integer containing the total bill amount
Example
Input
20 1 30
Output
600
Problem Solving Steps
1. Understand the problem statement - 
2. Come up with new Test Cases - 
3. Come up with the Logic - 
4. Convert algo into code
5. Dry Run
6. Execution
Test Cases
1.
input: 50 0 31
output: 0
2. 
input: 220 4 30
output: 26400
3.
input: 5 100 30
output: 15000
Logic
1. Read the unit price, number of units sold per day, and number of days in a month.
2. Compute the monthly bill by multiplying the unit price, the number of units sold per day, and the total number of days in the month.
3. Display the computed monthly bill
Arrays
Arrays are 0-indexed.
String split
Split possible only on strings
It can be done on any character which needs to be passed.
Response will be an array of strings.
str.split(<character>)
typeof => tells the type of the data

Travel Concession
Given the age of the passenger, determine if s/he is eligible for travel discount.
If the person is more than 60 years of age, s/he is eligible. Otherwise, not eligible.
Input
Single line having an integer as the age
Output
Eligible/Not Eligible
Example
Input:
38
Output:
Not Eligible
Problem Solving Steps

Test Cases
1. 
Input
5
Output:
Not Eligible
2.
Input
75
Output
Eligible
3.
Input:
60
Output:
Not Eligible
Logic
1. Read the age. 
2. Compare the age with 60 to see if it is greater.
3. If greater, print Eligible.
4. Otherwise, print Not Eligible. 
Comparison Operators
Syntax
i/p:
o/p: boolean (true/false)
1. Less than <
    a < b ==> true if a is lesser than b. Otherwise false
    4 < 5 ==> true
    5 < 4 ==> false
    5 < 5 ==> false
2. Less than or equal to <=
    a <= b ==> true if a is lesser or equal to b. Otherwise false.
    4 <= 5 ==> true
    5 <= 4 ==> false
    5 <= 5 ==> true
3. Greater than >
    a > b ==> true if a is greater than b. Otherwise false.
    4 > 5 ==> false
    5 > 4 ==> true
    5 > 5 ==> false
4. Greater than or equal to >=
    a >= b ==> true if a is greater than or equal to b. Otherwise false
    4 >= 5 ==> false
    5 >= 4 ==> true 
    5 >= 5 ==> true
5. Equal ===
    a === b ==> true if a is equal to b. Otherwise false
    4 === 5 ==> false
    5 === 5 ==> true
    "Hello" === "Hello" ==> true
    "Hello" === "Hi" ==> false
    "Hello" === "hello" ==> false
6. Not Equal !=
    a != b ==> true if a is not equal to b. Otherwise false. 
                reverse of equal.
    4 != 5 ==> true
    5 != 5 ==> false
   "Hello" != "Hello" ==> false
    "Hello" != "Hi" ==> true
    "Hello" != "hello" ==> true  
Conditional Operators
if.. else
Syntax:
if(<condition>) {
} else {
}
if(<condition1>) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
} else if (<condition2>) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
} else {
    ...
    ..
    ....
}
==============================================================
Given the age and gender of the passenger, determine if s/he is eligible for travel discount.
If the person is more than 60 years of age, s/he is eligible.
Otherwise if the person is Female, she is eligible if she is greater than 58 years of age.
Otherwise not eligible.
Input
2 lines
<age> - integer
<Gender> - String - Male/Female
Output
Eligible/Not Eligible
Example
75
Male
Output:
Eligible
Input:
65
Female
Output:
Eligible

Eligible
3. 
Input
60
Male

Female
Output:
Eligible
Logic
1. Read the age and gender. 
2. Compare the age with 60. 
3. If the age is greater than 60, print eligible. 
4. If the age is lower, compare the age with 58 and gender with Female. 
5. If the age is greater than 58 and gender is female, print Eligible. 
6. Otherwise print Not Eligible;
Logical Operators
i/p: boolean
o/p: boolean
1. AND &&
    <condition1> && <condition2> ==> true if both conditions are true. Otherwise false;
    true && true ==> true
    true && false ==> false
    false && true ==> false 
    false && false ==> false
2. OR ||
    <condition1> || <condition2> ==> true if at least one of the 2 conditions are true. Otherwise false;
    true || true ==> true
    true || false ==> true
    false || true ==> true
    false || false ==> false
Example: 
5<6 && 6<7
================================================================
Homework
Perform the dry run for the same test cases for the following code. 
let age = parseInt(readLine());
let gender = readLine();
if(age > 60) {
    console.log("Eligible");
} 
if (age > 58 && gender === "Female") {
    console.log("Eligible");
} else {
    console.log("Not Eligible");
