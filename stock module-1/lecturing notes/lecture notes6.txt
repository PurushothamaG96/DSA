Logic:
1. Maintain 3 counts - 1 for each input_number.count1, count2, count3. Initialize  to 0.
2. Read the first unread input of customer.
3. If the input is 0, print the 3 counts and end.
4. If the input is 1, increment count1.
5. If the input is 2, increment count2.
6. If the input is 3, increment count3.
7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 for all inputs.
